# 2x16-LCD-library
This library is built using I2C protocol with PCF8574AT I/O expandor IC. This library allows the user to control the LCD display with just two wires!
The library can be used with STM32F3 Discovery board. Or yu might use it with other ARM processor but you have to change the I2C peripherals in both files.
